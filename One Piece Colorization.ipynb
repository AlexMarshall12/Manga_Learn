    "Manga stories are typically printed in black-and-white,[9] although some full-color manga exist (e.g., Colorful). Colorization of Manga is usually done after it is released in black and white format. This is often avoided because colorization is time-consuming[citation needed].\n",
    "\n",
    "To this point, the goal of this project is to aleviate this time consuming pain of colorization by using machine learning to train a model which will thereby be able to perform automatic colorization. It will train on colorized examples to identify shapes and objects in the manga image which are a consistent color. Then, when fed a black and white manga from the same artist and series, it should be able to guess the fill color by relating the properties of the shape to the training set. The same artist and series is chosen to simlify this procedure. Generalization may be part of expansion of this project if it goes well :). "

More than enough data to train on, and we will most likely only choose a small subset of this to train on, but we can always get more. All one piece chapters are available in many different places online\n",

    "A critical juncture at this point is to note that this project processes and uses SVG images rather than the jpg format in which most manga is distributed on the web. As I began this project, I ran into the age old adage: data cleaning is the 80% of the work. Getting these polygons out of the bitmaps would require the use of openCV and a custom graph cut algorithm to seperate these polygons from their brethen. Largely because this is a pain in the ass, I began to look for other options. 1 that was staring me in the face, was the SVG format. In this format, each polygon is described as a path. If only there was an easy way to covert bitmaps into SVGs.... but wait! Vector Magic to the rescue. As most software developers know, why build a tool when you can use one. \n",
